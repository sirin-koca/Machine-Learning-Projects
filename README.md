# Machine Learning with Python

## Fundamental machine learning concepts:

1. Supervised Learning: Supervised learning is a type of machine learning in which the model is trained on a labeled dataset, where the target variable is known. The goal is to predict the target variable for new, unseen data.

2. Unsupervised Learning: Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning in which the model is trained on an unlabeled dataset, where the target variable is unknown. The goal is to discover patterns and relationships in the data.

3. Semi-Supervised Learning: Semi-supervised learning is a type of machine learning that uses both labeled and unlabeled data to improve the accuracy of the model.

4. Reinforcement Learning: Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning in which an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties.

5. Neural Networks: Neural networks are a type of machine learning algorithm that are inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. They consist of layers of interconnected nodes that process information and learn to make predictions.

6. Deep Learning: Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses deep neural networks with multiple layers to learn complex patterns and relationships in the data.

7. Feature Extraction: Feature extraction is the process of identifying and selecting the most important features or variables in the dataset to use in the machine learning model.

8. Model Evaluation: Model evaluation is the process of assessing the performance of a machine learning model on new, unseen data. Common evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Project 1: Iris Flower Classification 
This is a simple machine learning project that predicts the type of flower based on its features. The project uses the famous Iris dataset, which contains information about three types of flowers: Iris Setosa, Iris Versicolor, and Iris Virginica. Each flower has four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

### Requirements
- Python 3
- Scikit-learn
- NumPy
### Installation
You can install the required libraries using pip: ```pip install scikit-learn numpy```

### Usage
1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/iris-classification.git
2. Navigate to the project directory: ```cd iris-classification```
3. Run the Python script: ```python iris_classification.py```

The script will load the Iris dataset, split it into training and testing sets, choose a k-nearest neighbors classifier, train and evaluate the model, and then display the accuracy of the model on the test data.
