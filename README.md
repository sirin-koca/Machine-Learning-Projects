# Machine Learning with Python

## Project 1: Iris Flower Classification 
This is a simple machine learning project that predicts the type of flower based on its features. The project uses the famous Iris dataset, which contains information about three types of flowers: Iris Setosa, Iris Versicolor, and Iris Virginica. Each flower has four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

### Requirements
- Python 3
- Scikit-learn
- NumPy
### Installation
You can install the required libraries using pip: ```pip install scikit-learn numpy```

### Usage
1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/iris-classification.git
2. Navigate to the project directory: ```cd iris-classification```
3. Run the Python script: ```python iris_classification.py```

The script will load the Iris dataset, split it into training and testing sets, choose a k-nearest neighbors classifier, train and evaluate the model, and then display the accuracy of the model on the test data.
